# class in python 
# class - class is a blueprint of object 
# class is a user define data type 
# class is a container in we store methods(function) and properties

# syntax of class
#     in python for creatin class you can use a class keyword 

# Object - is an instance variable of class. by using object we can access properties and methods of the class in python we can create object by using following syntax

# object name = class name

# NOTE - for accessing the member of an class we can use object with dot operator 

# self in python 
# self represent the instance of the class . by usin the self keyword  we can access the attributs and methods of the class in python
# 2. it binds the attribute with the given argument 
# 3. in python the self is not a keyword it should be first argument of the method we can access attributes or instance inside the class 
# 4. it is an arbittery argument they can have any name
